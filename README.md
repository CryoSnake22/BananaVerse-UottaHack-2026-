# BananaVerse

BananaVerse is a hackathon project (uOttaHack 2026) that makes surveys feel playful instead of repetitive.  
As participants answer questions, their choices are mapped to visual elements (tree, weather, house, etc.), and the backend generates a single final AI landscape that reflects their full response.

## What This Project Is

- A **survey builder + survey player** web app.
- An **AI image generation pipeline** that converts scored answers into a cohesive landscape.
- A concept for improving survey completion by making feedback feel creative and rewarding.

## Where The Landscape Images Come From

The two images below are generated by this project and saved by the backend in `Backend/assets/_landscapes_/`.

  <img src="Backend/assets/_landscapes_/final_composite_landscape.png" width="700" alt="Final composite AI-generated landscape from BananaVerse">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="Backend/assets/_landscapes_/demolandscape.png" width="700" alt="Demo AI-generated landscape from BananaVerse">
</p>

- `final_composite_landscape.png`: output of the full survey-to-landscape generation flow.
- `demolandscape.png`: an additional generated demo/example output.

## How It Works (End-to-End)

1. **Organizer creates a survey** in the frontend (`Frontend/Survey-Monkey-Upgrade`).
2. Each question is tied to a category and visual options (pre-made or AI-generated asset sets).
3. **Participant completes the survey** by selecting options.
4. Frontend sends answer data to `POST /generate-landscape` on the FastAPI backend.
5. Backend builds prompts and generates a final composite image using Gemini, then stores it in `Backend/assets/_landscapes_/`.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React + Vite
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- AI: Google Gemini API
- Image processing/storage: local filesystem under `Backend/assets/`

## Project Structure

- `Frontend/Survey-Monkey-Upgrade/` - React app for creating and taking surveys.
- `Backend/server.py` - API endpoints (`/generate`, `/generate-landscape`, `/generate-pun`).
- `Backend/survey_landscape.py` - core survey-to-landscape composition logic.
- `Backend/main.py` - progressive per-element asset generation.
- `Backend/assets/` - generated image outputs and static assets.

## Run Locally

### 1) Backend

```bash
cd Backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install fastapi uvicorn requests
```

Create `Backend/.env`:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Start backend:

```bash
uvicorn server:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 2) Frontend

```bash
cd Frontend/Survey-Monkey-Upgrade
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Recruiter-Friendly Summary

BananaVerse demonstrates:

- Product thinking (reframing a low-engagement workflow: surveys).
- Full-stack implementation (React frontend + Python/FastAPI backend).
- Practical GenAI integration (prompted image generation + API orchestration).
- A user-centric outcome: participants receive a visual artifact from their responses, increasing engagement potential.

## My Contribution

I built the entire backend, including:

- LangGraph-based generation workflows for asset progression and survey-to-landscape composition.
- Prompt engineering for consistent, score-driven visual outputs across landscape elements.
- FastAPI backend endpoints and orchestration (`/generate`, `/generate-landscape`, `/generate-pun`).
- Gemini API integration for both image generation and text generation use cases.
